Given N × M array of integers, and Q queries, for each query, find the minimum and maximum values of the integers in the rectangle with the upper left corner (0, 0) and the lower right corner (n, m), given Q equals the values of n and m separated by a space.
Input:
The first line contains three integers N, M, and Q (1 ≤ N, M, Q ≤ 10000) — the size of the array N × M and the number of queries Q.
Each of the following N lines contains M integers separated by a space — the array.
Each of the next Q lines contains four integers x1, x2, y1, y2 (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ N, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ M) — the upper left and lower right corners of the rectangle.
Output:
For each query, print the result minimum and maximum of the integers in the rectangle separated by a space.
Sample Input:
4 5 3
2 3 1 6 2
3 2 1 5 3
5 6 2 3 1
9 6 3 7 2
2 4 1 3
2 5 3 4
1 2 2 4
Sample Output:
1 9
1 7
1 6
Explanation:
for the first query, the rectangle is:
3 2 1
5 6 2
9 6 3
the minimum number in the rectangle is 1, and the maximum number is 9, so the result is 1 9.
for the second query, the rectangle is:
1 5
2 3
3 7
the minimum number in the rectangle is 1, and the maximum number is 7, so the result is 1 7.
for the third query, the rectangle is:
3 1 6
2 1 5
the minimum number in the rectangle is 1, and the maximum number is 6, so the result is 2 6.
